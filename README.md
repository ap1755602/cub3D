#  Raycasting 42project
In this project, we recreated the dynamic scope of a 3D maze from the first person<br/><br/>
In the .cub file you can substitute your own wall textures using .xpm files, change the floor and ceiling colors in R, G, B decimal format [0, 255] and use your own map<br/><br/>
Run project: ./cub3D ur_configuration_file.cub<br/>
