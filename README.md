#  Raycasting project
In this project, we recreated the dynamic scope in a maze from a vision of first person<br/><br/>
In the .cub file you can substitute your own wall textures using .xpm files, change floor and ceiling colors in R, G, B decimal format [0, 255] and insert your own maze map<br/><br/>
Run project: ./cub3D ur_configuration_file.cub<br/>
